# 🗣️ Speech Recognition System with Python

A real-time speech-to-text application developed as part of an AI Engineering Bootcamp. This project demonstrates how to convert spoken language into written text using Python libraries and AI services.

## 📌 Features

- 🎙️ Process live microphone input and audio files
- 🧠 Use Google's SpeechRecognition API and OpenAI's Whisper for transcription
- 📊 Visualize waveforms using Librosa and Matplotlib
- 🧪 Evaluate transcription accuracy using Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER)
- 🔁 Text-to-Speech (TTS) using gTTS

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- `speech_recognition`
- `librosa`
- `matplotlib`
- `whisper`
- `jiwer`
- `gTTS`
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 File Structure

- `speech_01.wav` – Sample audio input
- `speech_recognition_notebook.ipynb` – Main project notebook
- `README.md` – Project overview

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/speech-recognition-python.git
   cd speech-recognition-python
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
